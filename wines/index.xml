You will get a dark ruby red wine with intense mature red fruit fragrances, or should I say grapes that endured some of the highest temperatures of the country? Best enjoyed with red meat, fatty fisch and soft cheese. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to invite your friends!

It&amp;rsquo;s prickly, it&amp;rsquo;s fresh and its best served cold, even on ice if you may. This should be your new aperitivo, your new &amp;ldquo;Sekt auf Eis&amp;rdquo;, the wine everyone wants you to bring to their dinner parties, lunches or BBQ.

Vale da Raposaâ€™s Goveio and Malvasia Fina are a great combination and a good example of the underground character of portuguese white wine grape varieties and the unique, pungent taste that only the climate of the Douro Valley can give to their grapes.</description></item><item><title>Zimbro</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/zimbro-doc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/zimbro-doc/</guid><description>Douro in it&amp;rsquo;s full power! This thick inky tinto made of the local Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Francesa is a great example of this region&amp;rsquo;s exceptional wines. And this family run vineyard is pure winemaker art, that you should definitely about. Enjoy it best with friends and a nice plate of pasta, red meats or your favourite cheese.</description></item></channel></rss>
