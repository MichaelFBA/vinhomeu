Yes green, there is a green wine out there and it grows in Minho, a region on the very north of Portugal that rhymes exquisitely with &amp;ldquo;vinho&amp;rdquo; and funilly enough it is one of the greenest in the whole country. No surprise then that this is home to the DOC region of vinho verde grapes that you will find nowhere else in the world. Back in the days, thanks to a glitch in the fermentation process, the wine ended up having more &amp;ldquo;bubbles&amp;rdquo; than usual.</description></item></channel></rss>
