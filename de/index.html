You will get a dark ruby red wine with intense mature red fruit fragrances, or should I say grapes that endured some of the highest temperatures of the country? Best enjoyed with red meat, fatty fisch and soft cheese. Don&rsquo;t forget to invite your friends!</p><p><a href=/region/portugal>Link</a></p>Santo do Monte<p>This &ldquo;Saint of the Hill'' embodies the freshness that a good Vinho Verde should always aim to transmit: a long summer evening in a citrus orchard. It&rsquo;s prickly, it&rsquo;s fresh and its best served cold, even on ice if you may. This should be your new aperitivo, your new &ldquo;Sekt auf Eis&rdquo;, the wine everyone wants you to bring to their dinner parties, lunches or BBQ.</p><p><a href=/region/portugal>Link</a></p>Zimbro DOC<p>Douro in it&rsquo;s full power! This thick inky tinto made of the local Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Francesa is a great example of this region&rsquo;s exceptional wines. And this family run vineyard is pure winemaker art, that you should definitely about. Enjoy it best with friends and a nice plate of pasta, red meats or your favourite cheese.</p></div></main></body></html>
