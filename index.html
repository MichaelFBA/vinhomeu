You will get a dark ruby red wine with intense mature red fruit fragrances, or should I say grapes that endured some of the highest temperatures of the country? Best enjoyed with red meat, fatty fisch and soft cheese. Don&rsquo;t forget to invite your friends!</p><p><a href=/region/portugal>Link</a></p><h2>Santo do Monte</h2><p></p><p>Serve cold</p><p>This &ldquo;Saint of the Hill'' embodies the freshness that a good Vinho Verde should always aim to transmit: a long summer evening in a citrus orchard. It&rsquo;s prickly, it&rsquo;s fresh and its best served cold, even on ice if you may. This should be your new aperitivo, your new &ldquo;Sekt auf Eis&rdquo;, the wine everyone wants you to bring to their dinner parties, lunches or BBQ.</p><p><a href=/region/portugal>Link</a></p><h2>Vale da Raposa</h2><p>2018</p><p></p><p>This was one of the first Douro white wines produced by the Alves de Sousa family, who started to turn their attention to the local grapes to produce outstanding wines. Vale da Raposa’s Goveio and Malvasia Fina are a great combination and a good example of the underground character of portuguese white wine grape varieties and the unique, pungent taste that only the climate of the Douro Valley can give to their grapes.</p><h2>Zimbro DOC</h2><p>2015</p><p>Drink at 16-18°C</p><p>Douro in it&rsquo;s full power! This thick inky tinto made of the local Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Francesa is a great example of this region&rsquo;s exceptional wines. And this family run vineyard is pure winemaker art, that you should definitely about. Enjoy it best with friends and a nice plate of pasta, red meats or your favourite cheese.</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://www.vinhomeu.com/>Vinhomeu</a></span>
