I miss the ease of being able to grab a bottle of wine and know that it will not be disappointing. In Portugal this is practically common sense, but I am not in Portugal anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berlin has great wine shops, but I want to make this even easier. So I started Vinho Meu, where I will be curating and showcasing a handful of great portuguese wines, no more, no less, just enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life’s too short for sh°t wine and I am here to help you with that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Convento da Vila Colheita</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/convento-da-vila-colheita-doc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/convento-da-vila-colheita-doc/</guid><description>Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional: an eclectic blend of amazing grapes. 15 months from harvest to your glass. You will get a dark ruby red wine with intense mature red fruit fragrances, or should I say grapes that endured some of the highest temperatures of the country? Best enjoyed with red meat, fatty fisch and soft cheese. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to invite your friends!</description></item><item><title>Santo do Monte</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/santo-do-monte/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/santo-do-monte/</guid><description>This &amp;ldquo;Saint of the Hill'' embodies the freshness that a good Vinho Verde should always aim to transmit: a long summer evening in a citrus orchard. It&amp;rsquo;s prickly, it&amp;rsquo;s fresh and its best served cold, even on ice if you may. This should be your new aperitivo, your new &amp;ldquo;Sekt auf Eis&amp;rdquo;, the wine everyone wants you to bring to their dinner parties, lunches or BBQ.</description></item><item><title>Vale da Raposa</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/vale-da-raposa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/vale-da-raposa/</guid><description>This was one of the first Douro white wines produced by the Alves de Sousa family, who started to turn their attention to the local grapes to produce outstanding wines. Vale da Raposa’s Goveio and Malvasia Fina are a great combination and a good example of the underground character of portuguese white wine grape varieties and the unique, pungent taste that only the climate of the Douro Valley can give to their grapes.</description></item><item><title>Varieties</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/varieties/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/varieties/</guid><description>Vinho Verde Verde stands for green. Yes green, there is a green wine out there and it grows in Minho, a region on the very north of Portugal that rhymes exquisitely with &amp;ldquo;vinho&amp;rdquo; and funilly enough it is one of the greenest in the whole country.
No surprise then that this is home to the DOC region of vinho verde grapes that you will find nowhere else in the world. Back in the days, thanks to a glitch in the fermentation process, the wine ended up having more &amp;ldquo;bubbles&amp;rdquo; than usual.</description></item><item><title>Zimbro</title><link>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/zimbro-doc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 14:29:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.vinhomeu.com/wines/zimbro-doc/</guid><description>Douro in it&amp;rsquo;s full power! This thick inky tinto made of the local Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Francesa is among the top 7% of the best wines in the world according to vivino.com and is a great example of this region&amp;rsquo;s exceptional wines. This family run vineyard is pure winemaker art, that you should definitely about. Enjoy it best with friends and a nice plate of pasta, red meats or your favourite cheese.</description></item></channel></rss>
