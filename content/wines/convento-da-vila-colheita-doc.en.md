Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional: an eclectic blend of amazing grapes. 15 months from harvest to your glass. You will get a dark ruby red wine with intense mature red fruit fragrances, or should I say grapes that endured some of the highest temperatures of the country? Best enjoyed with red meat, fatty fisch and soft cheese. Don't forget to invite your friends!
