This "Saint of the Hill'' embodies the freshness that a good Vinho Verde should always aim to transmit: a long summer evening in a citrus orchard. It's prickly, it's fresh and its best served cold, even on ice if you may. This should be your new aperitivo, your new "Sekt auf Eis", the wine everyone wants you to bring to their dinner parties, lunches or BBQ.
