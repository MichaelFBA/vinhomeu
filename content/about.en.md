I paid too much money for a disappointing wine at a wine shop. I miss the ease of being able to grab a bottle of wine and know that it will not be disappointing. In Portugal this is practically common sense, but I am not in Portugal anymore. 

Berlin has great wine shops, but I want to make this even easier. So I started Vinhomeu, where I will be curating and showcasing a handful of great portuguese wines, no more, no less, just enough. 

Life’s too short for sh°t wine and I am here to help you with that.

I was born in a wine country. Wine is part of our daily life, there is at least one glass of it present at every meal (back in the days even at breakfast). The supermarket is filled with reds, whites, rosés and verdes. Wine is omnipresent, it’s a common place, absolutely normal. My grandparents had grapes and made wine, just for the simple fact that it was cheaper to do so and you could also make some money with it, by either selling the grapes or the final product (and also from working for others during harvest). It was something done out of need, a normal part of life in Portugal's rural areas. Because of these humble origins, my take on wine has always been very simple: full bodied and velvety, I cannot come up with flavours, but only think of grapes that got the right amount of sun, the right amount of rain and were properly looked after.

And I have been lucky enough to witness this care first hand. My grandparents always had wine grapes and oak barrels, and my father also got more and more into making wine: testing, trying, using his in-laws’ vineyards, dedicating time and money to make sure the grapes were fertilized enough and the weeds on the ground were eliminated. The pure definition of biological agriculture: 1 person and its fruits.
As the years passed, the size of the vineyard decreased, the expertise grew and wine was maturing alongside, new grapes were introduced, velvety tones and full body pours were coming of age. As for me, I stopped complaining about getting up early and then napping under some massive vine bower. Humans and wine alike, we all mature so I started to be more interested in it alongside the whole family. Harvesting the grapes became a second Christmas for us.
